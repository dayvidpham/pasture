# PreToolUse hook: block destructive git operations for worker agents on
# shared worktrees.
#
# Why this exists:
#   The /pasture:worker role forbids destructive git ops on shared
#   worktrees (git reset --hard, git checkout HEAD -- <path>, git stash
#   pop/apply, git clean -fd, git branch -D). The rule has been broken in
#   real parallel-worker sessions with real data loss. This hook is the
#   runtime backstop to that role guidance.
#
# Activation (IMPORTANT — currently latent):
#   The hook enforces only when PASTURE_ROLE == "worker" is present in the
#   session environment. No launcher exports PASTURE_ROLE yet, so until
#   that env var is plumbed (e.g. by the intree agent launcher and/or the
#   worker role self-exporting it), this hook is a silent no-op. See the
#   wiring follow-up referenced by the PR that introduced this file.
#
# Behaviour:
#   - Reads the PreToolUse JSON event from stdin.
#   - Activates only when tool_name == "Bash" AND PASTURE_ROLE == "worker".
#     For other roles or tools, exits 0 silently (no-op).
#   - When the Bash command matches a forbidden pattern, prints a
#     plain-language error to stderr and exits 2 (blocking error).
#   - Provides an env-var escape hatch: set BYPASS_GIT_DISCIPLINE=1 in the
#     environment of the agent session to skip enforcement entirely
#     (intended for "I'm alone on this branch" cases — must be justified
#     in a bd comment).
#
# Hooks must NOT block on transient failure: if jq is missing or the
# input cannot be parsed, the hook exits 0 (allow) rather than 2
# (block) — failing open is the right choice for a backstop because
# the role guidance remains the primary authority.

Error: This destructive git operation is blocked for worker agents.

  Problem:   You tried to run \`${matched_label}\`, which would discard
             uncommitted work in this worktree — including changes by
             other workers running in parallel against the same tree.
  Reason:    Workers share the worktree. Destructive git operations here
             have already caused real data-loss incidents in parallel-worker
             sessions.
  Where:     Worker pre-tool-use git-discipline hook
             (hooks/scripts/git-discipline.sh).
  Impact:    Your command was blocked. Nothing in the worktree changed.
             You still need to decide how to proceed (see "How to fix").
  How to fix:
    1. If you wanted to discard your own staged changes only, use the
       safe per-file form (does not affect peer worker work):
         git restore --staged <specific-files>
       or, to drop your unstaged edits to a specific file:
         git restore <specific-files>
    2. If unexpected files in the worktree are blocking your fix,
       they are almost certainly peer-worker work-in-progress.
       Do NOT clean them up. Post a coordination comment on your
       slice task and wait for supervisor direction:
         bd comments add <your-task-id> "Blocked: peer-worker changes present in <files>; need supervisor coordination."
    3. If you genuinely need to run this command (for example,
       resolving a merge conflict on a branch where you are the only
       worker), bypass this hook for that single command by setting:
         BYPASS_GIT_DISCIPLINE=1 ${matched_label} <args>
       and record in a \`bd comments add\` why the bypass was needed.
    4. The full rationale and the complete list of forbidden operations
       are documented in this hook's header and the /pasture:worker role
       guidance.
