# User Request (Phase 1)

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED FROM pasture schema -->
**Command:** `pasture:user:request` — Capture user feature request verbatim (Phase 1)

**-> [Full workflow in PROCESS.md](../protocol/PROCESS.md#phase-1-request-aurap1-user)** <- Phase 1

**[user-req-verbatim-capture]**
- Given: user provides request
- When: capturing
- Then: store verbatim without paraphrasing
- Should not: summarize or interpret

**[user-req-classify-label]**
- Given: request captured
- When: classifying
- Then: use `pasture:p1-user:s1_1-classify` label
- Should not: use other labels for the initial capture

**[user-req-research-depth]**
- Given: classification complete
- When: user confirms research depth
- Then: run s1_2-research and s1_3-explore in parallel
- Should not: skip research depth confirmation

**[user-req-proceed-to-elicit]**
- Given: Phase 1 complete
- When: proceeding
- Then: invoke `/pasture:user-elicit` for Phase 2
- Should not: skip to proposal

**[user-req-fix-intent]**
- Given: a request whose user intent is to FIX existing behavior (a bug, regression, or incorrect output)
- When: classifying in Phase 1
- Then: recognize the fix-intent SEMANTICALLY during classification (record it in the classification comment) so the downstream URE/UAT/impl validation cases capture the currently-failing behaviours; validation cases themselves are elicited for EVERY request regardless
- Should not: introduce a request-type axis or enum to detect fix-intent — recognition is semantic, not a fifth classification axis; gate validation cases on fix-intent

**[frag--validation-cases]**
- Given: any REQUEST (every request, not only fix-intent ones)
- When: eliciting (URE), acceptance-testing (UAT), or implementing
- Then: elicit concrete validation cases — a definition of done plus correct and incorrect behaviours (inputs/behaviors that must pass or must fail), confirm the case set with the user in UAT, evaluate the implementation against them, and store failing real-data cases as test fixtures
- Should not: ship without validation cases; treat validation cases as applying to fix-intent requests only; introduce a request-type axis or enum to gate them

## Phase 1 Sub-steps

| Sub-step | Label | Description | Parallel? |
|----------|-------|-------------|----------|
| s1_1-classify | `pasture:p1-user:s1_1-classify` | Capture verbatim + classify along 4 axes | Sequential (first) |
| s1_2-research | `pasture:p1-user:s1_2-research` | Find domain standards, prior art | Parallel with s1_3 |
| s1_3-explore | `pasture:p1-user:s1_3-explore` | Codebase exploration for integration points | Parallel with s1_2 |

## Step 1: Capture and Classify (s1_1)



### Capture verbatim and create the request task

1. **Get the user's request verbatim:**
   ```
   AskUserQuestion: "What feature or change would you like to request?"
   ```

2. **Create the request task:**
   ```bash
   bd create --labels "pasture:p1-user:s1_1-classify" \
     --title "REQUEST: {{short summary}}" \
     --description "{{VERBATIM user request - do not edit}}" \
     --assignee architect
   ```

3. **Classify along 4 axes:**
   - **Scope:** Single file, module, cross-cutting
   - **Complexity:** Low, medium, high
   - **Risk:** Breaking changes, new API, internal-only
   - **Domain novelty:** Familiar patterns vs new territory

4. **Record classification** via comment on the request task:
   ```bash
   bd comments add {{request-task-id}} \
     "Classification: scope={{scope}}, complexity={{complexity}}, risk={{risk}}, novelty={{novelty}}"
   ```

### Recognize fix-intent (semantic, NOT a classification axis)

Separately from the 4 axes above, judge **semantically** whether the user's intent is to **FIX existing behavior** (a bug, regression, or wrong output) versus build something new. This is a recognition step, **not a fifth axis and not a `request-type` enum** — do not add a typed field for it.

When the intent is to fix existing behavior, the **validation-case lifecycle** applies for the rest of the epoch: concrete failing/expected cases are elicited in URE (`/pasture:user-elicit`), confirmed with the user in UAT (`/pasture:user-uat`), evaluated against the fix, and the failing real-data cases are stored as test fixtures.

Record the recognition in the same classification comment so downstream phases pick it up:
```bash
bd comments add {{request-task-id}} \
  "Fix-intent: yes — validation-case lifecycle applies (elicit cases in URE, confirm in UAT, store as fixtures)"
```

## Step 2: Research Depth Confirmation

After classification, confirm research depth with the user:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Based on classification ({{scope}}, {{complexity}}, {{risk}}, {{novelty}}), how deep should research go?"
  header: "Research Depth"
  options:
    - label: "Quick scan"
      description: "Familiar domain, low complexity — brief prior art check"
    - label: "Standard research"
      description: "Moderate complexity or some novelty — find existing patterns and standards"
    - label: "Deep dive"
      description: "High complexity, new territory, or high risk — thorough domain analysis"
```

## Step 3: Record Depth + Spawn Parallel Agents (s1_2 || s1_3)



### Record depth and spawn agents

Record the user's depth choice, then spawn two parallel agents:

```bash
bd comments add {{request-task-id}} \
  "Research depth: {{depth}} (user confirmed)"
```

Spawn both agents in parallel (via Task tool with `run_in_background: true`). Each agent invokes its dedicated skill.

### s1_2-research: Domain Research

Invoke `/pasture:research` with:
- **topic:** derived from the user's request
- **depth:** the user-confirmed research depth
- **request-task-id:** the REQUEST beads task ID

The `/pasture:research` skill handles the full research workflow: depth-scoped checklist, structured report written to `docs/research/<topic>.md`, and summary comment on the REQUEST task.

See [skills/research/SKILL.md](../research/SKILL.md) for full procedure, output format, and examples.

**Depth determines scope:**

| Depth | Local | Web | Deliverable |
|-------|-------|-----|-------------|
| **Quick scan** | Grep project for related patterns, check README/docs | None | 1-paragraph summary of local findings |
| **Standard research** | Local scan + check project dependencies, related repos | Search for domain standards, established patterns | List of prior art with relevance notes |
| **Deep dive** | Full local analysis + dependency tree | Search for competing solutions, RFCs, academic papers, well-regarded projects | Structured report: standards found, competing approaches, recommended direction |

**Research checklist:**
1. What domain standards exist? (RFCs, specs, community conventions)
2. What well-regarded projects solve similar problems? (prior art)
3. What patterns are established in this domain? (idioms, best practices)
4. Are there existing solutions that could be reused or adapted?

**Record findings** as a comment on the REQUEST task:
```bash
bd comments add {{request-task-id}} \
  "Research findings ({{depth}}):
  - Standards: {{list or 'none found'}}
  - Prior art: {{list of projects/solutions}}
  - Patterns: {{established approaches}}
  - Recommendation: {{brief direction}}
  - Full report: docs/research/{{topic}}.md"
```

### s1_3-explore: Codebase Exploration

Invoke `/pasture:explore` with:
- **topic:** derived from the user's request
- **depth:** the user-confirmed research depth (same depth applies)
- **request-task-id:** the REQUEST beads task ID

The `/pasture:explore` skill handles the full exploration workflow: depth-scoped checklist, structured findings, and summary comment on the REQUEST task.

See [skills/explore/SKILL.md](../explore/SKILL.md) for full procedure, output format, and examples.

**Exploration checklist:**
1. **Entry points:** Where would this feature plug in? (CLI commands, API routes, event handlers)
2. **Data flow:** What existing data structures, types, or schemas are relevant?
3. **Dependencies:** What modules/packages would this feature depend on or extend?
4. **Existing patterns:** How do similar features work in this codebase? (conventions, DI patterns, test structure)
5. **Conflicts:** Are there existing implementations that would need modification or could conflict?

**Depth determines thoroughness:**

| Depth | Scope | Tools |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **Quick scan** | Grep for keywords, check obvious entry points | Glob, Grep |
| **Standard research** | Trace data flow, map dependencies, read related modules | Glob, Grep, Read |
| **Deep dive** | Full dependency graph, architectural analysis, identify all touchpoints | Glob, Grep, Read, Bash (for build/dep tools) |

**Record findings** as a comment on the REQUEST task:
```bash
bd comments add {{request-task-id}} \
  "Explore findings ({{depth}}):
  - Entry points: {{list of files/functions}}
  - Related types: {{existing types/schemas}}
  - Dependencies: {{modules this would use}}
  - Patterns: {{how similar features work here}}
  - Conflicts: {{potential issues or 'none'}}"
```

### Completion

Both agents must complete before proceeding to Phase 2. Their findings are recorded as comments on the REQUEST task, available for the elicitation survey and proposal phases.

## Example

User says: "I want to add a logout button to the header that clears the session and redirects to the login page"

```bash
bd create --labels "pasture:p1-user:s1_1-classify" \
  --title "REQUEST: Add logout button to header" \
  --description "I want to add a logout button to the header that clears the session and redirects to the login page" \
  --assignee architect
# Returns: bd-abc123

bd comments add bd-abc123 \
  "Classification: scope=module, complexity=low, risk=internal-only, novelty=familiar"
```

## Next Phase

After Phase 1 completes, invoke `/pasture:user-elicit` to begin requirements elicitation (Phase 2).

The elicit task will block this request task:
```bash
bd dep add {{request-task-id}} --blocked-by {{elicit-task-id}}
```
