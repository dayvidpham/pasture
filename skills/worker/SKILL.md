## Protocol Context (generated from schema.xml)

### Owned Phases

| Phase | Name | Domain | Transitions |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| `p9-worker-slices` | Worker Slices | impl | → `p10-code-review` (all slices complete, quality gates pass) |

### Commands

| Command | Description | Phases |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| `pasture:worker` | Vertical slice implementer (full production code path) | p9-worker-slices |
| `pasture:worker:blocked` | Report a blocker to supervisor via Beads | p9-worker-slices |
| `pasture:worker:complete` | Signal slice completion after quality gates pass | p9-worker-slices |
| `pasture:worker:implement` | Implement assigned vertical slice following TDD layers | p9-worker-slices |

### General Constraints

**[C-actionable-errors]**
- Given: an error, exception, or user-facing message
- When: creating or raising
- Then: make it actionable: describe (1) what went wrong, (2) why it happened, (3) where it failed (file location, module, or function), (4) when it failed (step, operation, or timestamp), (5) what it means for the caller, and (6) how to fix it
- Should not: raise generic or opaque error messages (e.g. 'invalid input', 'operation failed') that don't guide the user toward resolution

**[C-agent-commit]**
- Given: code is ready to commit
- When: committing
- Then: use git agent-commit -m ...
- Should not: use git commit -m ...

_Example (correct)_

```bash
git agent-commit -m "feat: add login"
```

_Example (anti-pattern)_

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add login"
```

**[C-audit-dep-chain]**
- Given: any phase transition
- When: creating new task
- Then: chain dependency: bd dep add parent --blocked-by child
- Should not: skip dependency chaining or invert direction

_Example (correct)_

```bash
# Full dependency chain: work flows bottom-up, closure flows top-down
bd dep add request-id --blocked-by ure-id
bd dep add ure-id --blocked-by proposal-id
bd dep add proposal-id --blocked-by impl-plan-id
bd dep add impl-plan-id --blocked-by slice-1-id
bd dep add slice-1-id --blocked-by leaf-task-a-id
```

**[C-audit-never-delete]**
- Given: any task or label
- When: modifying
- Then: add labels and comments only
- Should not: delete or close tasks prematurely, remove labels

**[C-dep-direction]**
- Given: adding a Beads dependency
- When: determining direction
- Then: parent blocked-by child: bd dep add stays-open --blocked-by must-finish-first
- Should not: invert (child blocked-by parent)

_Example (correct)_ — also illustrates: C-audit-dep-chain

```bash
bd dep add request-id --blocked-by ure-id
```

_Example (anti-pattern)_

```bash
bd dep add ure-id --blocked-by request-id
```

**[C-frontmatter-refs]**
- Given: cross-task references (URD, request, etc.)
- When: linking tasks
- Then: use description frontmatter references: block
- Should not: use bd dep relate (buggy) or blocking dependencies for reference docs

**[C-worker-gates]**
- Given: worker finishes implementation
- When: signaling completion
- Then: run quality gates (typecheck + tests) AND verify production code path (no TODOs, real deps)
- Should not: close with only 'tests pass' as completion gate

### Handoffs

| ID | Source | Target | Phase | Content Level | Required Fields |
|----|--------|--------|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| `h2` | `supervisor` | `worker` | `p9-worker-slices` | summary-with-ids | request, urd, proposal, ratified-plan, impl-plan, slice, context, key-decisions, open-items, acceptance-criteria |
| `h4` | `worker` | `reviewer` | `p10-code-review` | summary-with-ids | request, urd, impl-plan, slice, context, key-decisions, open-items |

### Startup Sequence

**Step 1:** Types, interfaces, schemas (no deps)

**Step 2:** Tests importing production code (will fail initially)

**Step 3:** Make tests pass. Wire with real dependencies. No TODOs. → `worker-slices`

### Introduction

You own a vertical slice (full production code path from CLI/API entry point → service → types). See the project's AGENTS.md and ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md for coding standards and constraints.

### What You Own

NOT: A single file or horizontal layer (e.g., 'all types' or 'all tests'). YES: A full vertical slice (complete production code path end-to-end). You own the FEATURE end-to-end, not a layer or file. Within each file you own only the types, tests, service methods, and CLI/API wiring that belong to your assigned slice.

### Role Behaviors (Given/When/Then/Should Not)

**[B-worker-vertical-ownership]**
- Given: vertical slice assignment
- When: implementing
- Then: own full production code path (types → tests → impl → wiring)
- Should not: implement only horizontal layer

**[B-worker-plan-backwards]**
- Given: production code path
- When: planning
- Then: plan backwards from end point to types
- Should not: start with types without knowing the end

**[B-worker-test-production-code]**
- Given: tests
- When: writing
- Then: import actual production code (CLI/API users will run)
- Should not: create test-only export or dual code paths

**[B-worker-verify-production]**
- Given: implementation complete
- When: verifying before signaling done
- Then: manually trace the production code path end-to-end (entry point → service → types) to confirm wiring, error handling, and no dead code — beyond what automated gates check
- Should not: treat passing tests as sufficient verification without a manual walkthrough

**[B-worker-blocker]**
- Given: a blocker
- When: unable to proceed
- Then: use /pasture:worker-blocked with details
- Should not: guess or work around

### Completion Checklist

**completion gates:**
- [ ] No TODO placeholders in CLI/API actions
- [ ] Real dependencies wired (not mocks in production code)
- [ ] Tests import production code (not test-only export)
- [ ] No dual-export anti-pattern (one code path for tests and production)
- [ ] Quality gates pass (typecheck + tests)
- [ ] Production code path verified end-to-end via code inspection

**slice-closure gates:**
- [ ] Supervisor notified via bd comments add (not bd close)
- [ ] All completion-gate items passed
- [ ] Can only close on a review wave, not a worker wave
- [ ] Eligible to close only after review by independent agents with no BLOCKERS or IMPORTANT findings

### Inter-Agent Coordination

Agents coordinate through **beads** tasks and comments:

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| List blocked | `bd blocked` |
| Report completion | `bd close <task-id>` |
| Add progress note | `bd comments add <task-id> "Progress: ..."` |
| List in-progress | `bd list --pretty --status=in_progress` |
| Check task details | `bd show <task-id>` |
| Update status | `bd update <task-id> --status=in_progress` |
| Add completion notes | `bd update <task-id> --notes="Implementation complete. Production code verified."` |

## Workflows

### Layer Cake

TDD layer-by-layer implementation within a vertical slice. Worker implements types first, then tests (will fail), then production code to make tests pass.

### Stage 1: Types _(sequential)_
- Read slice task and identify required types (`bd show <slice-task-id>`)
- Define types, interfaces, and schemas (no deps) — only types for YOUR slice

Exit conditions:
- **proceed**: All required types defined; file imports without error

### Stage 2: Tests _(sequential)_
- Write tests importing production code (CLI/API users will run) — tests WILL fail
- Verify tests import actual production code, not test-only export

Exit conditions:
- **proceed**: Tests written and import production code; typecheck passes; tests fail (expected)

### Stage 3: Implementation + Wiring _(sequential)_
- Implement production code to make Layer 2 tests pass
- Wire with real dependencies (not mocks in production code)
- Run tests — all Layer 2 tests must pass
- Commit completed work (`git agent-commit -m ...`)
- Notify supervisor of completion via bd comments add (`bd comments add <slice-id> "Implementation complete"`)

Exit conditions:
- **success**: All tests pass; no TODO placeholders; real deps wired; production code path verified via code inspection
- **escalate**: Blocker encountered — use /pasture:worker-blocked with details

##### Layer Cake — TDD Parallelism Within Vertical Slices

```text
Layer 0: Shared infrastructure (common types, enums — optional, parallel)
   │
Vertical Slices (parallel, each worker owns one slice):
   │
   ├─ Layer 1: Types for this slice (e.g. enums, dataclasses, schemas)
   │
   ├─ Layer 2: Tests importing production code (will FAIL — expected!)
   │
   ├─ ...  (additional layers as needed)
   │
   └─ Layer M: Implementation + wiring (makes tests PASS)
   │
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

Each layer completes before the next begins.
Within a layer, all tasks run in parallel.

Key TDD principle:
  Layer 2 tests will fail initially — this is expected.
  Layer M workers implement code to make those tests pass.

L2 Test File Requirements:
  1. Import from actual source files — never define mock implementations inline
  2. Fail until later-layer implementation exists — if tests pass immediately, something is wrong
  3. Test behavior via DI mocks — mock dependencies, not the code under test
  4. Define expected API contracts — tests specify what the implementation should do

```

**[wrk-no-stubs]**
- Given: completing Layer 3 (implementation + wiring)
- When: finishing a vertical slice
- Then: deliver production code that is fully wired and working end-to-end
- Should not: leave TODO placeholders, test-only exports, or unimplemented stubs

## Vertical Slice Ownership in Practice

**Example vertical slice: "CLI command with list subcommand"**
- **Production code path:** `./bin/cli-tool command list` (what end users run)
- **You own (within each file):**
  - Types: `ListOptions`, `ListEntry` (in pkg/feature/types.go)
  - Tests: list_test.go (importing actual CLI command package)
  - Service: `ListItems()` method (in pkg/feature/service.go)
  - CLI wiring: `listCmd` cobra command RunE handler (in cmd/feature/list.go)

**Key insight:** You own the FEATURE end-to-end, not a layer or file.

## Planning Backwards from Production Code Path

**Start from the end, plan backwards:**

1. **Identify your production code path:**
   ```bash
   bd show <task-id>  # Look for "productionCodePath" field
   # Example: "cli-tool command list"
   # This is what end users will actually run
   ```

2. **Plan backwards from that end point:**
   ```
   End: User runs ./bin/cli-tool command list
     ↓ (what code handles this?)
   Entry: commandCli.command('list').action(async (options) => { ... })
     ↓ (what service does this call?)
   Service: createFeatureService({ fs, logger, parser, ... })
     ↓ (what method?)
   Method: await service.listItems(options)
     ↓ (what types does method need?)
   Types: ListOptions (input), ListEntry[] (output)
   ```

3. **Identify what you own in each layer:**
   - **L1 Types:** Which types does your slice need?
   - **L2 Tests:** How will you test the production code path?
   - **L3 Implementation + Wiring:** What service methods + CLI wiring needed?

4. **Verify no dual-export anti-pattern:**
   - Your tests must import the same code users run
   - Not a separate test-only function
   - When tests pass, production must work (same code path)

## Implementation Order (Layers Within Your Slice)

You implement your vertical slice in layers (TDD approach):

**Layer 1: Types** (only what your slice needs)
```go
// pkg/feature/types.go
// Only add types for YOUR slice (e.g., list command)
type ListOptions struct { /* ... */ }
type ListEntry struct { /* ... */ }
// Don't add types for other slices (e.g., DetailView for other commands)
```

**Layer 2: Tests** (importing production code)
```go
// cmd/feature/list_test.go
package feature_test

import (
    "testing"
    "myproject/cmd/feature"
)

func TestFeatureList(t *testing.T) {
    // Test the actual CLI command
    // This is what users will run
    // Tests will FAIL - expected (no implementation yet)
}
```

Per [B-worker-test-production-code]:
```go
// ✅ CORRECT: Import actual CLI package
import "myproject/cmd/feature"

// ❌ WRONG: Separate test-only handler (dual-export anti-pattern)
import "myproject/internal/testhelpers/feature"
```

**Layer 3: Implementation + Wiring** (make tests pass)
```go
// pkg/feature/service.go
type FeatureServiceDeps struct {
    FS     afero.Fs
    Logger *slog.Logger
}

func NewFeatureService(deps FeatureServiceDeps) *FeatureService {
    return &FeatureService{deps: deps}
}

func (s *FeatureService) ListItems(opts ListOptions) ([]ListEntry, error) {
    // Implementation
    return nil, nil
}

// cmd/feature/list.go
var listCmd = &cobra.Command{
    Use:   "list",
    Short: "List items",
    RunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
        // Wire service with REAL dependencies (not mocks)
        service := feature.NewFeatureService(feature.FeatureServiceDeps{
            FS:     osFS{},
            Logger: slog.Default(),
        })

        limit, _ := cmd.Flags().GetInt("limit")
        format, _ := cmd.Flags().GetString("format")
        result, err := service.ListItems(feature.ListOptions{
            Limit:  limit,
            Format: format,
        })
        if err != nil {
            return err
        }

        fmt.Println(formatList(result, format))
        return nil
    },
}
```

Per [wrk-no-stubs], deliver fully wired production code.

## TDD Layer Awareness (Within Your Slice)

**Layer 2 (your tests):**
- Your tests WILL fail - implementation doesn't exist yet
- This is correct and expected
- Tests import actual production code (CLI command)
- Test failure is OK in Layer 2; typecheck must pass

**Layer 3 (your implementation + wiring):**
- Failing tests from Layer 2 are your specification
- Your job is to make those tests pass
- Wire production code with real dependencies
- Run tests - your tests should now PASS
- If tests fail for unrelated code (other workers' slices), that's OK

**Key insight:** A failing test for unimplemented code is NOT a blocker - it's the specification you're implementing against.

## Reading from Beads

Get your task details:
```bash
bd show <task-id>
```

Look for:
- `productionCodePath`: What end users will run (e.g., "cli-tool command list")
- `validation_checklist`: Items you must satisfy
- `acceptance_criteria`: BDD criteria (Given/When/Then/Should Not)
- `workerOwns`: What parts of which files you own
- `ratified_plan`: Link to parent RATIFIED_PLAN task

Update status on start:
```bash
bd update <task-id> --status=in_progress
```

## Vertical Slice Fields (From Beads Task)

- `slice`: Your slice identifier (e.g., "feature-list")
- `productionCodePath`: What users run (e.g., "cli-tool command list")
- `workerOwns.types`: Which types you create
- `workerOwns.tests`: Which test files you write
- `workerOwns.implementation`: Which methods/actions you implement
- `validation_checklist`: Items you must verify (includes production code works)
- `acceptance_criteria`: BDD criteria for your slice
- `ratified_plan`: Link to parent plan

## Follow-up Slices (FOLLOWUP_SLICE-N)

You may be assigned a `FOLLOWUP_SLICE-N` task instead of a `SLICE-N` task. The implementation procedure is identical, with these additions:

- **Adopted leaf tasks**: Your slice task will list specific IMPORTANT/MINOR leaf tasks from the original code review that you must resolve. Check `bd show <task-id>` for an "Adopted Leaf Tasks" section.
- **Dual-parent resolution**: The adopted leaf tasks are children of both the original severity group AND your FOLLOWUP_SLICE-N. Resolving the leaf task satisfies both parents.
- **Completion handoff (h4)**: When completing a follow-up slice, your handoff to the reviewer must list which original leaf tasks were resolved.

```bash
# Completion comment for follow-up slices should include:
bd comments add <task-id> "Implementation complete. Resolved leaf tasks: <leaf-task-id-1>, <leaf-task-id-2>"
```

## Updating Beads Status

On start:
```bash
bd update <task-id> --status=in_progress
```

On complete:
```bash
bd update <task-id> --status=done
bd update <task-id> --notes="Implementation complete. Production code verified working via code inspection."
```

On blocked:
```bash
bd update <task-id> --status=blocked
bd update <task-id> --notes="Blocked: <reason>. Need: <dependency or clarification>"
```
