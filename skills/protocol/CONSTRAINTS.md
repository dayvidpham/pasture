# Aura Protocol Constraints

Common constraints referenced by all agent and skill files.

## Coding Standards

**Given** shared resources **when** modifying **then** use atomic operations with timeouts **should never** check-then-act

**Given** external input **when** parsing **then** validate at system boundaries with the project's schema/validation tooling **should never** trust raw input or cast types unsafely

**Given** parallel work **when** assigning files **then** ensure each file has exactly one owner with atomic commits **should never** have multiple workers on same file

**Given** a feature request **when** writing requirements **then** use Given/When/Then/Should,Should Not format **should never** write vague criteria

**Given** a class or struct with dependencies **when** designing **then** inject all deps (including clocks, loggers) **should never** hard-code

**Given** runtime events **when** logging **then** use structured logging with context **should never** log secrets or use unstructured print statements

**Given** status/type fields **when** defining **then** use strongly-typed enums **should never** use bare strings at API boundaries

**Given** an error, exception, or user-facing message **when** creating or raising **then** make it actionable: describe (1) what went wrong, (2) why it happened, (3) where it failed (file location, module, or function), (4) when it failed (step, operation, or timestamp), (5) what it means for the caller, and (6) how to fix it **should never** raise generic or opaque error messages (e.g., "invalid input", "operation failed") that don't guide the user toward resolution

**Given** code changes **when** committing **then** type checking and tests must pass **should never** allow optional CI

**Given** task is implemented **when** you are about to commit **then** you **should** use `git agent-commit -m ...`, **should never** use `git commit -m ...`

**Given** you want to execute Beads **when** you are about to call `bd <command> ...` **then** you **should never** `cd <repo_root> && bd <command> ...`, instead you **should** always just call `bd <command> ...`

## Checklists

### Security
- No secrets in code or logs
- Input validated at all boundaries
- No SQL/command injection vectors
- File permissions 0o600 for sensitive data

### Scalability
- No N+1 queries or unbounded loops
- All collections have bounded sizes
- Resource cleanup (timeouts, `defer`/`finally`, `.Close()`)

### Correctness
- Tests cover happy path AND error cases
- Types strict (no `any`, proper discriminated unions or typed enums)
- BDD acceptance criteria met
- Production code path verified via code inspection

## Vote Levels

| Vote | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| ACCEPT | No BLOCKER issues; all review criteria satisfied |
| REVISE | BLOCKER issues found; must provide actionable feedback |

Binary only. No intermediate levels.

## Issue Severity

| Severity | When to Use | Blocks |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| BLOCKER | Security, type errors, test failures, broken production code paths | Yes |
| IMPORTANT | Performance, missing validation, architectural concerns | No (tracked in follow-up epic) |
| MINOR | Style, optional optimizations, naming improvements | No (tracked in follow-up epic) |

**EAGER severity group creation:** For every code review round (Phase 10), ALWAYS create 3 severity group tasks (BLOCKER, IMPORTANT, MINOR) immediately. Empty groups have no children and are closed immediately. This is NOT lazy creation.

**Follow-up epic:** When a review round completes and ANY IMPORTANT or MINOR findings exist, the Supervisor creates a follow-up epic (label `aura:epic-followup`). This is NOT gated on BLOCKER resolution — it triggers as soon as the review round completes.

**Follow-up lifecycle:** The follow-up epic runs the same protocol phases with FOLLOWUP_* prefixed task types: FOLLOWUP_URE → FOLLOWUP_URD → FOLLOWUP_PROPOSAL → FOLLOWUP_IMPL_PLAN → FOLLOWUP_SLICE-N. The supervisor creates FOLLOWUP_URE and FOLLOWUP_URD, then hands off to architect via h6 for FOLLOWUP_PROPOSAL. Original IMPORTANT/MINOR leaf tasks are adopted by FOLLOWUP_SLICE-N (dual-parent: original severity group + follow-up slice).

**No followup-of-followup:** IMPORTANT/MINOR findings from FOLLOWUP_SLICE code review are tracked on the existing follow-up epic as tasks. A nested follow-up-of-followup epic is never created.

## Beads Task Naming & Tagging Standards

All work flows through Beads with standardized titles and the v2 label schema:

### Label Schema

```
Format: aura:p{phase}-{domain}:s{step}-{type}

Phase-domain pairs (12 phases):
  aura:p1-user     — Request + classify + research + explore
  aura:p2-user     — Elicit + URD
  aura:p3-plan     — Propose
  aura:p4-plan     — Plan review
  aura:p5-user     — Plan UAT
  aura:p6-plan     — Ratify
  aura:p7-plan     — Handoff
  aura:p8-impl     — Impl plan
  aura:p9-impl     — Worker slices
  aura:p10-impl    — Code review
  aura:p11-user    — Impl UAT
  aura:p12-impl    — Landing

Special labels:
  aura:urd                  — User Requirements Document
  aura:superseded           — Superseded proposal/plan
  aura:severity:blocker     — Blocker severity group
  aura:severity:important   — Important severity group
  aura:severity:minor       — Minor severity group
  aura:epic-followup        — Follow-up epic
```

### Planning Phase Tasks

| Title Format | Label | Purpose | Created By |
|---|---|---|---|
| `REQUEST: Description` | `aura:p1-user:s1_1-classify` | Capture user's problem statement | User or Coordinator |
| `PROPOSAL-N: Description` | `aura:p3-plan:s3-propose` | Architect's full technical proposal (N increments per revision) | Architect |
| `PROPOSAL-N-REVIEW-{axis}-{round}: Description` | `aura:p4-plan:s4-review` | Reviewer assessment of proposal N (axis=A/B/C, round=1,2,...) | Reviewers (spawned by architect) |
| `URD: Description` | `aura:urd` | Single source of truth for user requirements | Architect (after Phase 2 URE) |

### Implementation Phase Tasks

| Title Format | Label | Ownership |
|---|---|---|
| `IMPL_PLAN: Description` | `aura:p8-impl:s8-plan` | Supervisor |
| `SLICE-N: Description` | `aura:p9-impl:s9-slice` | One worker per slice |

**Vertical Slice Ownership Model:**
- Each **production code path** is owned by exactly ONE worker
- A worker owns the full vertical (types → tests → implementation → wiring)
- Never assign the same production code path to multiple workers
- Workers CAN share Layer 0 infrastructure (common types/enums)

### Naming Conventions

- **PROPOSAL-N:** N starts at 1 and increments with each revision. Old proposals are marked `aura:superseded`.
- **PROPOSAL-N-REVIEW-{axis}-{round}:** Axis identifies the reviewer's criteria focus (A=Correctness, B=Test quality, C=Elegance). Round increments per re-review cycle.
- **SLICE-N:** N identifies the slice number within the implementation plan.

### Follow-up Lifecycle Tasks

| Title Format | Label | Purpose | Created By |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FOLLOWUP: Description` | `aura:epic-followup` | Follow-up epic for non-blocking improvements | Supervisor |
| `FOLLOWUP_URE: Description` | `aura:p2-user:s2_1-elicit` | Scoping URE: which IMPORTANT/MINOR findings to address | Supervisor |
| `FOLLOWUP_URD: Description` | `aura:p2-user:s2_2-urd,aura:urd` | Requirements document for follow-up scope | Supervisor |
| `FOLLOWUP_PROPOSAL-N: Description` | `aura:p3-plan:s3-propose` | Architect's follow-up proposal (accounts for original URD + FOLLOWUP_URD) | Architect (after h6) |
| `FOLLOWUP_IMPL_PLAN: Description` | `aura:p8-impl:s8-plan` | Follow-up implementation plan | Supervisor (after follow-up h1) |
| `FOLLOWUP_SLICE-N: Description` | `aura:p9-impl:s9-slice` | Follow-up slice (adopts original leaf tasks as dual-parent children) | Supervisor |

### Frontmatter References

Instead of peer-reference commands, include task IDs in the description frontmatter:

```bash
bd create --title "URD: Feature name" \
  --description "---
references:
  request: <request-task-id>
  elicit: <elicit-task-id>
---
## Requirements
..."
```

This replaces the old peer-reference command for linking related tasks. The URD is a living reference document — not a blocking dependency.

### Design Field Schema (Canonical)

All implementation tasks use this structure in the `design` field:

```json
{
  "productionCodePath": "tool feature list",
  "validation_checklist": [
    "Type checking passes",
    "Tests pass",
    "Production code path implemented (not test-only export)",
    "Tests verify actual production code (CLI/API users will run)",
    "All TODO placeholders replaced with working code",
    "Production code verified (via code inspection: no TODOs, real deps wired)"
  ],
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    {
      "given": "implementation complete",
      "when": "user runs production code",
      "then": "it works (not just tests passing)",
      "should_not": "have separate test-only code paths or dual-export anti-pattern"
    }
  ],
  "tradeoffs": [
    {
      "decision": "chosen approach",
      "rationale": "why this over alternatives"
    }
  ],
  "ratified_plan": "<task-id>"
}
```

---

## User Requirements Document (URD)

**Given** Phase 2 (URE) completes **when** creating the URD **then** use label `aura:urd` and include structured requirements (priorities, design choices, MVP goals, end-vision goals) **should never** leave requirements scattered across REQUEST and ELICIT tasks without a URD

**Given** a URD exists **when** linking to other tasks **then** include the URD task ID in the description frontmatter of referencing tasks (e.g., `urd: <urd-id>`) **should never** use `--blocked-by` for URD links — it is a reference document, not a blocking dependency

**Given** scope changes at any phase **when** updating requirements **then** add a comment to the URD via `bd comments add <urd-id> "..."` **should never** leave the URD out of date when UAT results, ratification, or user feedback modify requirements

## Documentation Standards

All documentation must follow these patterns:

### Command File Headers

Every `skills/*/SKILL.md` file must start with:

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: Brief role/purpose
---

# Agent Name

Brief description of role. See `CONSTRAINTS.md` for coding standards.

**-> [Full workflow in PROCESS.md](PROCESS.md#phase-x)** <- Link to relevant phase
```

### Section Organization

Use consistent structure:
- **Given/When/Then/Should** constraints (borrowed from BDD)
- **Tools & Skills** table (what this agent can do)
- **Common Patterns** with correct/wrong examples
- **See Also** section linking to PROCESS.md

### Code Examples

Always show both:
1. **CORRECT pattern** (preferred approach)
2. **WRONG pattern** (anti-pattern to avoid)

With explanatory comments.

### Linking Convention

**PROCESS.md links:**
```markdown
-> [Full workflow in PROCESS.md](PROCESS.md#phase-1-request)
```

**CONSTRAINTS.md links:**
```markdown
See `CONSTRAINTS.md` for [section name]
```

**Cross-file references in commands:**
```markdown
See: [../agent/SKILL.md](../agent/SKILL.md)
```
