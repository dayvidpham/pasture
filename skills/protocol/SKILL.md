## Quick Reference

### 12 Phases

1. **REQUEST** — Capture user request verbatim, classify, research, explore
2. **ELICIT + URD** — Requirements elicitation survey, create URD
3. **PROPOSAL-N** — Architect creates technical proposal
4. **REVIEW** — 3 axis-specific reviewers (A/B/C), binary ACCEPT/REVISE
5. **Plan UAT** — User acceptance test on the plan
6. **RATIFY** — Ratify accepted proposal, mark old as superseded
7. **HANDOFF** — Architect hands off to supervisor
8. **IMPL_PLAN** — Supervisor decomposes into vertical slices
9. **SLICE-N** — Workers implement slices in parallel
10. **Code Review** — 3 reviewers, severity tree (BLOCKER/IMPORTANT/MINOR)
11. **Impl UAT** — User acceptance test on the implementation
12. **LANDING** — Atomic commit, push, hand off

### Label Format

```
aura:p{phase}-{domain}:s{step}-{type}
```

### Follow-up Lifecycle

**Trigger:** Phase 10 code review completes with ANY IMPORTANT or MINOR findings (not gated on BLOCKER resolution).

**Owner:** Supervisor creates follow-up epic (label `aura:epic-followup`).

**Flow:**
```
Code Review (Phase 10) finds IMPORTANT/MINOR findings
  → Supervisor creates FOLLOWUP epic
    → FOLLOWUP_URE (supervisor, aggregated findings as requirements)
      → FOLLOWUP_URD (supervisor, single source of truth for follow-up)
        → h6 handoff: Supervisor → Architect
          → FOLLOWUP_PROPOSAL (architect proposes fix plan)
            → Review (same 3-axis review)
              → h1 handoff: Architect → Supervisor
                → FOLLOWUP_IMPL_PLAN (supervisor decomposes)
                  → FOLLOWUP_SLICE-N (workers implement)
                    → Code Review (severity tree, same process)
```

Original IMPORTANT/MINOR leaf tasks are adopted as children of FOLLOWUP_SLICE-N (dual-parent). No followup-of-followup — findings from follow-up code review stay on the existing follow-up epic.

### Agent Roles

| Role | Phases | Key Responsibility |
|------|--------|--------------------|
| Epoch | 1-12 | Master orchestrator |
| Architect | 1-7 | Specs, proposals, review coordination |
| Reviewer | 4, 10 | End-user alignment review |
| Supervisor | 7-12 | Task decomposition, worker allocation |
| Worker | 9 | Vertical slice implementation |
