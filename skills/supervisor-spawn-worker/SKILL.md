# Supervisor Spawn Worker

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED FROM aura schema -->
**Command:** `aura:supervisor:spawn-worker` — Launch a worker agent for an assigned slice

### Ride the Wave — Coordinated Phase 8-10 Execution

```text
Phase 8: PLAN
  ├─ Read RATIFIED_PLAN + URD
  ├─ Spawn ephemeral Explore subagents (Task tool, scoped queries)
  ├─ Use Explore findings to map codebase
  ├─ Decompose into vertical slices + integration points
  └─ Create leaf tasks for every slice

Phase 9: BUILD
  ├─ Spawn N Workers for parallel slice implementation
  ├─ Workers implement their slices in parallel
  └─ Workers do NOT shut down when finished

Phase 10: REVIEW + FIX CYCLES (max 3 per slice)
  ├─ Cycle 1:
  │   ├─ Spawn ephemeral reviewers (Task tool, per-slice review)
  │   ├─ Reviewers review ALL slices (severity tree: BLOCKER/IMPORTANT/MINOR)
  │   ├─ Create FOLLOWUP epic if ANY IMPORTANT/MINOR findings
  │   ├─ Workers fix BLOCKERs + IMPORTANTs with atomic commits
  │   └─ Spawn new ephemeral reviewers for re-review
  ├─ Cycle 2 (if needed): same pattern
  ├─ Cycle 3 (if needed): same pattern
  └─ After 3 cycles per slice: escalate to architect for re-planning

DONE → Phase 11 (UAT)
  └─ Shut down Workers

Cycle Exit Conditions:
  All reviewers ACCEPT, 0 BLOCKERs + 0 IMPORTANTs     → Proceed to Phase 11 (UAT)
  BLOCKERs or IMPORTANTs remain, cycles < 3 per slice → Workers fix, spawn new ephemeral reviewers
  3 cycles exhausted, IMPORTANT remain                → Track in FOLLOWUP, proceed to Phase 11
  3 cycles exhausted per slice, BLOCKERs remain       → Escalate to architect for re-planning

```

Launch the wave of workers for parallel vertical slice implementation, reviewed by ephemeral reviewers.

**-> [Full workflow in PROCESS.md](../protocol/PROCESS.md#phase-9-worker-slices)** <- Phase 9

**Given** implementation tasks **when** spawning **then** use Task tool with `run_in_background: true` **should never** block on worker completion

**Given** multiple workers **when** launching **then** spawn all slices in parallel as a single wave **should never** spawn sequentially

**Given** worker assignment **when** providing context **then** include Beads task ID, full context, and handoff document **should never** omit checklist or criteria

**Given** worker handoff **when** creating **then** store at `.git/.aura/handoff/<request-task-id>/supervisor-to-worker-<N>.md` **should never** skip handoff document

**Given** workers complete their slices **when** first wave finishes **then** do NOT close slices — ephemeral reviewers must review ALL slices first **should never** close a slice that has not been reviewed at least once

**Given** reviewers finish reviewing **when** BLOCKERs or IMPORTANT findings exist **then** send findings to workers for fixing, then spawn new ephemeral reviewers for re-review **should never** skip re-review after fixes

**Given** worker-reviewer cycle **when** counting iterations **then** limit to a MAXIMUM of 3 cycles **should never** exceed 3 cycles — if IMPORTANT findings remain after cycle 3, move to UAT and track remaining in FOLLOWUP epic

**Given** IMPORTANT findings remain after 3 cycles **when** deciding next step **then** proceed to Phase 11 (UAT) — all remaining IMPORTANT and MINOR findings must be tracked in the FOLLOWUP Beads epic **should never** block UAT on non-BLOCKER findings after 3 cycles

## When to Use

Implementation tasks ready. Ephemeral reviewers will be spawned per-slice during review phase.

## Ride the Wave — Overview

The supervisor executes Phases 8-10 as a single coordinated cycle called **Ride the Wave**:

```
1. PLAN  → supervisor-plan-tasks: decompose into slices + integration points
2. EXPLORE → Ephemeral Explore subagents (Task tool): map codebase, short-lived
3. BUILD → N Workers: implement slices in parallel
4. REVIEW → Ephemeral reviewers (Task tool): review per-slice
5. FIX   → Workers fix BLOCKERs + IMPORTANTs with atomic commits
6. RE-REVIEW → Spawn new ephemeral reviewers for re-review
7. REPEAT → Steps 5-6 up to MAX 3 cycles per slice
8. TRACK → IMPORTANT/MINOR findings → FOLLOWUP epic
9. NEXT  → If clean or 3 cycles exhausted → Phase 11 (UAT) or escalate to architect
```

**Key rules:**
- Reviewers are ephemeral (spawned per review cycle via Task tool)
- Slices are **never closed** until reviewed at least once
- Max **3 review cycles per slice** — escalate to architect after cycle 3 if BLOCKERs remain

## Handoff Template (Supervisor → Worker)

Before spawning each worker, create a handoff document:

**Storage:** `.git/.aura/handoff/<request-task-id>/supervisor-to-worker-<N>.md`

```markdown
# Handoff: Supervisor → Worker <N>

## Context
- Request: <request-task-id>
- URD: <urd-task-id>
- IMPL_PLAN: <impl-plan-task-id>
- Ratified Proposal: <proposal-task-id>

## Your Slice
- Slice: SLICE-<N>
- Task ID: <slice-task-id>
- Production Code Path: <what end users run>

## Key Files
| File | What You Own |
|------|-------------|
| pkg/feature/types.go | ListOptions, ListEntry types |
| cmd/feature/list_test.go | List command tests |
| pkg/feature/service.go | ListItems() method |
| cmd/feature/list.go | list subcommand wiring |

## Implementation Order
1. Layer 1: Types (your slice only)
2. Layer 2: Tests (import production code — will FAIL, expected)
3. Layer 3: Implementation + Wiring (make tests PASS)

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Production code verified via code inspection
- [ ] Tests import actual CLI (not test-only export)
- [ ] No dual-export anti-pattern
- [ ] No TODO placeholders
- [ ] Service wired with real dependencies

## Persistence
Do NOT shut down after implementation. You will receive review feedback
and may need to fix BLOCKERs and IMPORTANT findings. Stay alive for the
full Ride the Wave cycle.
```

## Task Call

```
Task({
  description: "Worker: implement SLICE-N",
  prompt: `Call Skill(/aura:worker) and implement the assigned slice.

Beads Task ID: <task-id>
Read full requirements: bd show <task-id>
Handoff doc: .git/.aura/handoff/<request-task-id>/supervisor-to-worker-<N>.md

Do NOT shut down after implementation. You will receive review feedback and may need to fix issues.`,
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  run_in_background: true
})
```

**Important:** Use `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`, not a custom agent type. The worker skill is invoked inside the agent via `Skill(/aura:worker)`.

## TeamCreate: SendMessage Assignment

When workers are spawned via TeamCreate, they receive context through SendMessage instead of a Task prompt. The message MUST be self-contained — teammates have **no prior context**:

```
SendMessage({
  type: "message",
  recipient: "worker-1",
  content: `You are assigned SLICE-1. Start by calling Skill(/aura:worker).

Your Beads task ID: <slice-task-id>
Run this to get full requirements: bd show <slice-task-id>
Handoff document: .git/.aura/handoff/<request-task-id>/supervisor-to-worker-1.md

Key references (run bd show on each for full context):
- Request: <request-task-id>
- URD: <urd-task-id>
- IMPL_PLAN: <impl-plan-task-id>
- Ratified Proposal: <proposal-task-id>

Read the handoff doc and your Beads task before starting implementation.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT shut down after completing implementation. You will receive
review feedback from ephemeral reviewers and may need to fix BLOCKERs and IMPORTANT
findings. Stay alive for the full Ride the Wave cycle.`,
  summary: "SLICE-1 assignment with Beads context"
})
```

**Critical:** Never send bare instructions like "implement SLICE-1" without Beads task IDs and `bd show` commands. Teammates cannot see your conversation or task tree.

## Worker Persistence (Ride the Wave)

Workers are **never shut down** after completing their first implementation pass. They stay alive for the review-fix cycle:

1. Worker completes slice → notifies supervisor
2. Supervisor does **NOT** close the slice or shut down the worker
3. Ephemeral reviewers review the slice
4. If BLOCKERs or IMPORTANT findings: supervisor sends fix assignment to worker
5. Worker fixes issues → notifies supervisor
6. New ephemeral reviewers re-review
7. Repeat steps 4-6 up to MAX 3 cycles total
8. After 3 cycles or all clean: supervisor shuts down worker

### Fix Assignment Message Template

```
SendMessage({
  type: "message",
  recipient: "worker-1",
  content: `Review cycle <N> found issues in your slice (SLICE-1).

BLOCKERs (must fix — blocks slice closure):
- <finding-id>: <description> (bd show <finding-id>)

IMPORTANT (must fix this cycle):
- <finding-id>: <description> (bd show <finding-id>)

After fixing all items:
  bd comments add <slice-id> "Fixes applied for review cycle <N>"

Do NOT shut down. Ephemeral reviewers will re-review.`,
  summary: "Review cycle <N> fixes for SLICE-1"
})
```

## Worker Should Update Beads Status

- On start: `bd update <task-id> --status=in_progress`
- On implementation complete (NOT slice close): `bd comments add <task-id> "Implementation complete, awaiting review"`
- On blocked: `bd update <task-id> --notes="Blocked: <reason>"`
- Slice closure: **only the supervisor** closes slices after review passes

## Assign via Beads

```bash
bd update <task-id> --assignee="<worker-agent-name>"
bd update <task-id> --status=in_progress
```

## Follow-up Slice Handoff (FOLLOWUP_SLICE-N)

For follow-up slices, the handoff template extends with additional fields:

**Storage:** `.git/.aura/handoff/{followup-epic-id}/supervisor-to-worker-<N>.md`

```markdown
# Handoff: Supervisor → Worker <N> (Follow-up)

## Context
- Original Request: <request-task-id>
- Follow-up Epic: <followup-epic-id>
- FOLLOWUP_URD: <followup-urd-id>
- FOLLOWUP_IMPL_PLAN: <followup-impl-plan-id>

## Your Slice
- Slice: FOLLOWUP_SLICE-<N>
- Task ID: <slice-task-id>

## Adopted Leaf Tasks
| Leaf Task ID | Severity | Original Slice | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| <leaf-id-1> | IMPORTANT | SLICE-1 | <description> |
| <leaf-id-2> | MINOR | SLICE-2 | <description> |

## Acceptance Criteria
- Both adopted leaf tasks resolved (tests pass, production code path verified)
- See bd task <slice-task-id> for full validation_checklist
```
